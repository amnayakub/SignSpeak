# SignSpeak-A sign language detector
SignSpeak is a real-time sign language recognition app that uses your webcam to detect hand gestures for the ASL alphabets and converts them into complete sentences. It helps bridge communication gaps by translating finger-spelled sign language into readable and spoken text.
